## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Authentication failed"

**Solutions:**
1. **Gmail:** Make sure you're using App Password, not your regular password
2. **Check username:** Must be full email address (info@heybuddydesign.com)
3. **Check password:** No spaces, copy directly from source
4. **Enable "Less secure apps"** (if using Gmail without 2FA - not recommended)

### Problem: "Connection timeout"

**Solutions:**
1. **Try different port:**
   - Port 587 with TLS
   - Port 465 with SSL/TLS
   - Port 25 (usually blocked)
2. **Try different host:**
   - smtp.gmail.com
   - mail.privateemail.com vs smtp.privateemail.com
3. **Check firewall:** Render might block certain ports
4. **Contact Render support** if issue persists

### Problem: "Connection refused"

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify SMTP host** is correct
2. **Check port** matches security setting
3. **Verify email account** is active
4. **Check account limits** (daily sending limits)

### Problem: "Emails not arriving"

**Solutions:**
1. **Check spam/junk folder**
2. **Verify "From" email** is correct
3. **Check email provider limits**
4. **Use authenticated email** (don't use different From address)
5. **Wait 5-10 minutes** (sometimes delayed)
