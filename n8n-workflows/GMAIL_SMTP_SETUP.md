## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Error: "Invalid credentials"

**Solutions:**

1. **Check the app password:**
   - Must be 16 characters
   - No spaces
   - Copy it directly, don't type it
   - Generate a new one if unsure

2. **Verify email address:**
   - Must be: info@heybuddydesign.com
   - Must match the Gmail account that created the app password

3. **Make sure you're using APP PASSWORD, not regular Gmail password**

### Error: "2-Step Verification required"

**Solution:**
- Go back to Step 1
- Enable 2-Step Verification
- Then create app password

### Error: "Connection timeout"

**Solutions:**

1. **Try alternative port:**
   ```
   Port: 465
   Security: SSL/TLS
   ```

2. **Check Render isn't blocking port:**
   - Port 587 usually works on Render
   - Contact Render support if blocked

### Error: "App Passwords option not available"

**Reasons:**

1. **2-Step Verification not enabled:**
   - Enable it first (see Step 1)

2. **Using Google Workspace (work/school account):**
   - Admin might have disabled app passwords
   - Ask admin to enable
   - Or use a personal Gmail account

3. **Advanced Protection enabled:**
   - Can't use app passwords with Advanced Protection
   - Need to disable or use different account
