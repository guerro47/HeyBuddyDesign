## üìã What You Need

1. **n8n Instance** (cloud or self-hosted)
2. **Your n8n Webhook URL** (we'll get this after setup)
3. **Email Configuration** (info@heybuddydesign.com)

## üöÄ Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Import the Workflow

1. Go to your n8n instance
2. Click **"Workflows"** ‚Üí **"Import from File"**
3. Select: `01-lead-capture-to-crm-uk.json`

### Step 2: Get Your Webhook URL

2. Click the **"Webhook - Contact Form"** node (first node)
3. Click **"Execute Node"** button
4. Copy the **Production URL** (looks like this):
   ```
   https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/contact-form
   ```

### Step 3: Update Website Contact Form

Replace the webhook URL in your website's `index.html` file.

**Find this section (around line 1520):**
```javascript
// Here you would typically send the data to your backend:
// fetch('/api/contact', {
```

**Replace with:**
```javascript
// Send to n8n webhook
try {
    const response = await fetch('YOUR_N8N_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(formData)
    });

    const result = await response.json();

    if (response.ok && result.success) {
        // Show success message
        successMessage.classList.add('show');
        this.reset();
    } else {
        alert('Something went wrong. Please try again or email us at info@heybuddydesign.com');
    }
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
    alert('Something went wrong. Please email us at info@heybuddydesign.com');

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Webhook Not Working

**Problem:** Form submits but nothing happens

**Solutions:**
1. Check workflow is **activated** (green toggle)
2. Verify webhook URL is correct in `index.html`
3. Check browser console for errors (F12)
4. Test webhook directly:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-n8n-url/webhook/contact-form \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "name": "Test",
       "email": "test@example.com",
       "budget": "¬£500-¬£1,000",
       "timeline": "Within 1 month",
       "service": "Business Website",
       "message": "Test message"
     }'
   ```

### Emails Not Sending

**Problem:** Workflow runs but emails don't arrive

**Solutions:**
1. Check spam folder
2. Verify SMTP credentials in n8n
3. Test SMTP connection (click "Test" in credentials)
4. Check email quota/limits
5. For Gmail: Enable "Less secure app access"

### Lead Score Always 0

**Problem:** All leads showing score of 0

**Solutions:**
1. Check budget field is being sent from form
2. Verify field names match exactly:
   - `budget` (not `Budget`)
   - `timeline` (not `Timeline`)
3. Check browser console for form data
4. Test the "Calculate Lead Score" function node manually

## üìä Your n8n Webhook URL

Once you have your n8n instance set up, paste your webhook URL here for reference:

```
Your Production Webhook URL:
https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/contact-form

(Replace this in index.html around line 1520)
```

---

## üîê Security Best Practices

### Add Webhook Secret

Protect your webhook from spam:

1. In the webhook node, add a secret header
2. Update form to include secret:
   ```javascript
   fetch('YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL', {
       method: 'POST',
       headers: {
           'Content-Type': 'application/json',
           'X-Webhook-Secret': 'your-secret-key-here'
       },
       body: JSON.stringify(formData)
   });
   ```

3. In n8n workflow, validate the secret:
   ```javascript
   // In "Validate & Clean Data" node
   const secret = $input.item.json.headers['x-webhook-secret'];
   if (secret !== 'your-secret-key-here') {
       throw new Error('Unauthorized');
   }
   ```

### Rate Limiting

Prevent form spam:

```javascript
// Add to workflow "Validate & Clean Data" node
const submissions = $workflow.getStaticData('submissions') || {};
const email = $json.email;
const now = Date.now();

// Allow 1 submission per email every 5 minutes
if (submissions[email] && (now - submissions[email]) < 300000) {
    throw new Error('Please wait before submitting again');
}

submissions[email] = now;
$workflow.setStaticData('submissions', submissions);
```
